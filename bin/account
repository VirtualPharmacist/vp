Dear user,

Thanks for choosing PGI. Due to the large size of exome sequencing data, please use FTP to upload your exome data to our server
for analysis. Your FTP account is: %s, password: %s;

There are many options available for FTP clients, such as Filezilla, Xmanager and SecureCRT.
Depending on the speed of internet connection and the size of your data, the uploading may takes a few hours. 
Please note that your FTP account will expire in 7 days.

Best regards,
