SNP_ID	Allele	Gene	Drug	Evidence_level	Efficacy	Dosage	Toxicity	Genotype	Description
rs1045642	A > G	ABCB1	anthracyclines and related substances	Level 3	decreased	-	-	AG	                Patients with the AG genotype may have 1) decreased exposure to doxorubicin metabolites and 2) decreased response to anthracycline regimens as compared to patients with the AA genotype, however the evidence is highly contradictory and analysis of the heterozygote is limited. Other genetic and clinical factors may also influence response to anthracycline regimens.
rs1045642	A > G	ABCB1	antiepileptics	Level 3	increased	-	-	AG	                Genotype AG may be associated with increased likelihood of drug resistance when treated with antiepileptics in people with Epilepsy in Asian as compared to genotype GG. However, this finding has been contradicted with many studies reporting no association between this variant and response to antiepileptics. Theres also a report showing that genotype GG is associated with increased likelihood of drug-resistance when treated with antiepileptics as compared to genotype AA in Caucasian patients. Other genetic and clinical factors may influence a patients response to antiepileptics.
